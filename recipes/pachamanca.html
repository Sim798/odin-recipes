            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a hole in the ground where you want to prepare the Pachamanca</li>
                <li>Light a fire near where the Pachamanca is going to be prepared and heat a large amount of stones</li>
                <li>Once the stones are very hot, place a bed of these carefully in the bottom of the hole with the help of tweezers. On top of them, place the food in layers:</li>
                    
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The sweet potatoes, potatoes, oca potatoes, and then some hot stones on top</li>
                        <li>On the second layer, place the meats seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and aj√≠ panca to taste</li>
                        <li>Place most hot stones on top since the meats take longer to cook. All this is covered with plantain leaves to protect the food and avoid contact with soil.</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>On top, place the beans, cuy, portions of pariah cheese, bananas, and corn cobs and cover again with plantain leaves and a piece of jute.</li>
                <li>Cover the whole thing with a poncho or thick cloth to keep it warm</li>
            </ol>
